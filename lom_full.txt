Functions
add_new_notes
Parameter:
dictionary
Key: "notes" [list of note specification dictionaries]
Note specification dictionaries have the following keys:
pitch: [int] the MIDI note number, 0...127, 60 is C3.
start_time: [float] the note start time in beats of absolute clip time.
duration: [float] the note length in beats.
velocity (optional): [float] the note velocity, 0 ... 127 (100 by default).
mute (optional): [bool] 1 = the note is deactivated (0 by default).
probability (optional): [float] the chance that the note will be played:
1.0 = the note is always played
0.0 = the note is never played
(1.0 by default).
velocity_deviation (optional): [float] the range of velocity values at which the note can be played:
0.0 = no deviation; the note will always play at the velocity specified by the velocity property
-127.0 to 127.0 = the note will be assigned a velocity value between velocity and velocity + velocity_deviation, inclusive; if the resulting
range exceeds the limits of MIDI velocity (0 to 127), then it will be clamped within those limits
(0.0 by default).
release_velocity (optional): [float] the note release velocity (64 by default).
Returns a list of note IDs of the added notes.
For MIDI clips only.
Available since Live 11.0.
add_warp_marker
Only available for warped Audio Clips. Adds the specified warp marker, if possible.
The warp marker is specified as a dict which can have a beat_time and a sample_time key, both associated with float values.
The sample_time key may be omitted; in this case, Live will calculate the appropriate sample time to create a warp marker at the
specified beat time without changing the Clip's playback timing, similar to what would happen if you were to double-click in the upper
half of the Sample Display in Clip View.
If sample_time is specified, certain limitations must be taken into account:
The sample time must lie within the range [0, s], where s is the sample's length. The sample_length Clip property helps with this.
The sample time must lie between the left and right adjacents markers' respective sample times (this is a logical constraint).
Within these constraints, there are limitations on the resulting segments' BPM. The allowed BPM range is [5, 999].
apply_note_modifications
Parameter:
dictionary
Key: "notes" [list of note dictionaries] as returned from get_notes_extended.
The list of note dictionaries passed to the function can be a subset of notes in the clip, but will be ignored if it contains any notes that are
not present in the clip.

Call this before replace_selected_notes if you just want to add some notes.
Output:
deselect_all_notes id 0
For MIDI clips only.
duplicate_loop

note. This behavior can be observed when duplicating notes in the Live GUI.
If the transposition_amount is specified, the duplicated notes will be transposed by the number of semitones.
Available for MIDI clips only.
Available since Live 11.1.2

note properties as listed above in the discussion of the returned note dictionaries, e.g. ["note_id", "pitch", "velocity"]. The effect of this
will be that the returned note dictionaries will only contain the key-value pairs for the specified properties, which can be useful to

ControlSurface
A ControlSurface can be reached either directly by the root path control_surfaces N or by getting a list of active control surface IDs, via
calling get control_surfaces on an Application object.
The latter list is in the same order in which control surfaces appear in Live's Link/MIDI Preferences. Note the same order is not guaranteed
when getting a control surface via the control_surfaces N path.
A control surface can be thought of as a software layer between the Live API and, in this case, Max for Live. Individiual controls on the
surface are represented by objects that can be grabbed and released via Max for Live, to obtain and give back exclusive control (see
grab_control and release_control). In this way, parts of the hardware can be controlled via Max for Live while other parts can retain their
default functionality.
Additionally, Live offers a special MaxForLive control surface that has a register_midi_control function. Using this, Max for Live developers
can set up entirely custom control surfaces by adding and grabbing arbitrary controls.
Canonical path
control_surfaces N
Functions
get_control
Parameter: name
Returns the control with the given name.
get_control_names
Returns the list of all control names.
grab_control
Parameter: control
Take ownership of the control. This releases all standard functionality of the control, so that it can be used exclusively via Max for Live.
grab_midi
Forward MIDI messages received from the control surface to Max for Live.
register_midi_control
Parameters:
name [symbol]
status [int]
number [int]
(MaxForLive control surface only) Register a MIDI control defined by status and number. Supported status codes are 144 (note on), 176
(continuous control) and 224 (pitchbend).
Returns the LOM ID associated with the control.
Once a control is registered and grabbed via grab_control, Live will forward associated MIDI messages that it receives to Max for Live.
Max for Live can send values to the control (e.g. to light an LED) by calling send_value on the control object.
release_control
Parameter: control
Re-establishes the standard functionality for the control.
release_midi
Stop forwarding MIDI messages received from the control surface to Max for Live.
send_midi
Parameter: midi_message [list of int]
Send midi_message to the control surface.
send_receive_sysex
Parameters:
sysex_message [list of int]
timeout [symbol, int]
Send sysex_message to the control surface and await a response.
If the message is followed by the word timeout and a float, this sets the response timeout accordingly. The default timeout value is 0.2.
If the response times out and MIDI has not been grabbed via grab_midi, it's not forwarded to Max for Live. If MIDI has been grabbed via
Max for Live, received messages are always forwarded, but the timeout is still reported.
this_device
This root path represents the device containing the live.path object to which the goto this_device message is sent. The class of this
object is Device .
Canonical path
live_set tracks N devices M
